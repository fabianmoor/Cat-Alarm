## Project Overview
This project came to mind after noticing our mostly friendly cat "Gubben" starting emptying his bladder into the shower. Whilst better than on other furniture,
it still bothered me and my significant other. Especially when heading into the shower for a steamy refreshment, the odors can be quite unpleasant.
Hence, the **Cat Alarm**. It's a simple alarm that utilizes two **Piezo Buzzers** one **active** and one **passive** to produce an suddle sound unpleasant to
most unsuspecting felines. With great hopes of having Gubben rethink his choice of toilet. I will briefly cover how to assemble this machine.
